# iTerm2 API

This is an example of a command-line application using the iTerm2 API. It
allows you to perform various actions such as creating windows or switching
tabs.

## Installation

The easiest way to prepare an environment is to create a script in iTerm2.
Select **Scripts > New Python Script**. Select the *basic* environment and
*simple* script template. Name it `it2api`.

iTerm2 will install the Python runtime if needed and will create a template app
which it will open in your default Python editor.

Paste the contents of it2api into it.

You can then run `$HOME/Library/ApplicationSupport/iTerm2/Scripts/it2api`.
